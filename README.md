# AquaSense

The intention of AquaSense is to create a system capable of measuring electrical conductivity and relative temperature of water streams. The device will connect via Bluetooth to the AquaSense App, available for Android and iOS, capable of displaying a live feed of collected data and remotely configuring the sampling interval of the device for time series of varying resolutions.
